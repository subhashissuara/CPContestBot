# CPContestBot
A bot that creates a directory and files along with your template for CP contest.

**Note:**
1. You have to configure the python file by adding your details and directories. Examples to do so are available inside the file. 
2. The solution files will be named as a, b, c ... and hence the maximum number of files is 26. If you want your own naming format feel   free to fork and change the script.
